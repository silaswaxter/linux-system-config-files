# About
This repo contains custom configuration files for system programs (e.g. display manager lightdm).  Additionaly, the repo contains files to patch specific computer's (e.g. asus rog g14) functionality like volume control buttons, keyboard brightness control buttons, etc.

## Usage
This repo's directory should be placed somewhere in root space because symbolic links from user to root space are "bad"--not to mention the security concerns.  Symlinks properly resolve when this repo is placed at `/etc/`.

I'm using another account called "rootforsilas" on github and yahoo mail;  this allows root:root to own this whole repository ensuring security is intact--meanwhile my personal account gives access to this github profile allowing root to make changes.
